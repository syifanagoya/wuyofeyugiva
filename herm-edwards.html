According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Herm Edwards</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Herman Edwards Jr. (born April 27, 1954) is an American football coach and former player, as of 2018 the head coach at Arizona State University. From 2009 to 2017, he was a pro football analyst for ESPN. He played cornerback for ten seasons (1977–1986) with the Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, and Atlanta Falcons. Edwards is known for the 1978 “Miracle at the Meadowlands”, when he recovered a fumble by Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik, for a touchdown during the waning seconds of a certain Eagles loss, to turn it into a victory.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Following the 2005 season, Chiefs president Carl Peterson hinted to the press about interest in hiring Edwards that could have been considered tampering. The Jets granted permission to the Chiefs to speak with Edwards. At the time, Edwards had two years remaining on his contract with the Jets. However, Peterson wanted Edwards (a longtime personal acquaintance) to succeed head coach Dick Vermeil, who had just retired.</p><p>The 2006 season would see many highs and lows. Starting quarterback Trent Green suffered a serious concussion in the first game of the season. Despite Green’s injury, the Chiefs continued to stay in contention, largely thanks to backup quarterback Damon Huard and Pro Bowl running back Larry Johnson. In a move some considered controversial, Edwards chose to sit Huard and start Green when he returned from injury. At the time, Huard’s performance at quarterback was one of the best in the league, having thrown 11 touchdowns and just one interception, averaging 7.7 yards per pass attempt, and posting a quarterback rating of 98.0 (2nd best rating in the NFL, second to only Peyton Manning).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Herm Edwards height</b> Not available right now.

The Giants led 17–12 and the Eagles had no time-outs remaining, but instead of simply taking the snap from center and kneeling, Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik attempted to hand the ball off to running back Larry Csonka. However, the ball came loose and Edwards picked it up and returned it for a touchdown, enabling the Eagles to win 19–17. This play became known in Philadelphia as “The Miracle at the Meadowlands “and in New York City as simply “The Fumble.” The Eagles made the playoffs and the Giants finished at 6–10.</p><p align=justify>Before being hired in 2006 as the tenth head coach in Kansas City Chiefs history, Edwards was the head coach of the New York Jets from 2001 to 2005. He is known for his gameday terminology, dubbed “Hermisms” by fans. Of these, the quote and sound bite, “You play to win the game!”, a message that he gave during a Jets press conference, became the title of his book, a collection of “leadership lessons” for the reader to use as personal motivation.</p><h2>Who is Herm Edwards Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Herm Edwards</strong> married to <strong>Lia Edwards </strong>.
