She has also been very open about her personal life and her history of infidelities. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, Weaver said in an interview that she was proud to have stayed faithful to her fourth spouse, husband Sean Taylor, whom she married in 2003.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“I’ve never cheated on this one,” she said of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marriage with Taylor</a> before noting it was a “good effort” for someone like her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here’s a look at Weaver’s past relationships and what she has said about her views on love.</p><h2>Jacki Weaver on Love & Relationships</h2><p>Weaver has always had a very relaxed attitude towards sex and relationships. She expanded more on her views in her 2005 autobiography titled Much Love, Jac.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“I believe in sex on a first date,” she wrote at the time to highlight her approach to love and dating.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Otherwise, how do you know if a second date is worth the effort?”</p><p>In the past, Weaver has also gotten candid about being a victim of sexual abuse as a child by an adult family friend.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Jacki Weaver during an interview</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actress explained it was because of this experience that she felt protective of her loved ones and kept them away from the spotlight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She also shared <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another reason</a> for keeping her son and grandchildren from the public eye. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“My son and his family don’t like me talking about them in public, so I don’t mind much,” she said. “When you have grandchildren… it makes you extra protective when something has happened to you.”</p><h2>Jacki Weaver Has Been Married to Four Different Spouses</h2><p>Weaver has been romantically involved with many well-known names. She got married for the first time in 1966 to spouse&nbsp;David Price. She was 18 years old at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After four years together, Weaver left Price to be with director John Walter. Together, Weaver and Walter welcomed son Dylan Walters in 1970.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Unfortunately, Weaver’s relationship with the second spouse&nbsp;didn’t last long, and she moved on with director Richard Wherrett. Though she and Wherrett didn’t tie the knot or welcome any children together, she referred to him as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">love of her life</a>.</p><p>“I think everyone would acknowledge that. That’s not to diminish what I feel for the other men I love,” she shared.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I knew Richard was homosexual from the very beginning, but it didn’t affect my falling in love with him. It didn’t affect any aspect of our relationship.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Weaver later married boom mic operator Max Hensser in 1975. She and her second spouse&nbsp;remained married for two years until eventually separating in 1977. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress walked down the aisle with radio and TV presenter Derryn Hinch on February 25, 1983. They ended their marriage in 1996 after she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ran away</a> with another man.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, they would tie the knot once again in 1997 before splitting again in 1998.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Weaver married her fourth spouse, actor Sean Taylor, in 2003. The pair have been together ever since, and both of them have shared about each other in multiple instances.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRmLiqedaemK%2BdomLAsbvUrJxnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coco-austin-shows-off-tiny-baby-bump-at-7-months-pregnant-2015289.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coco Austin Shows Off Tiny Baby Bump at 7 Months Pregnant</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-dylan-grazer-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Dylan Grazer- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
