But unlike Hargitay, her life was full of scandal and drama. As with many celebrities, Mansfield enjoyed being the center of attention, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she didn’t mind raising eyebrows</a>. One of the ways she showed her flamboyant style was with her home, the Pink Palace. Its ornate decor and over-the-top luxury was the height of Hollywood fashion, and Mansfield loved it. But did she love it so much that she refused to leave it even after her death?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jayne-Mansfield-1.jpg><h2 id=h-jayne-mansfield-was-one-of-a-kind>Jayne Mansfield was one of a kind</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-2_60>Mansfield was an unusual kind of woman to become a sex symbol in the 1950s. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Louis Style</a>, she was a wife and a mother during an era when women with those responsibilities were expected to stay home. But Mansfield wanted to be a star, so she moved her family to Hollywood, and that’s exactly what she did.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_63>She was famous for her beauty and talent, but also for her lush sensuality, even posing naked for Playboy in 1955. She didn’t mind a little scandal, and she often shocked people with her relationship drama and tendency to pop out of low necklines.&nbsp;One of the ways she showed off her over-the-top style was with her beloved home, known as the Pink Palace.</p><h2 id=h-the-famous-pink-palace>The famous Pink Palace</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-4_76>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House Beautiful</a>, Mansfield and her husband at the time, Mickey Hargitay, bought an eight-bathroom, seven-bedroom home in Los Angeles in 1957. They painted it pink, which Mansfield said was her signature color, and called it the Pink Palace. The house was the height of luxury at the time, with seven fireplaces, one of which was outside. It was not only painted pink, but it was decorated from top to bottom in the romantic shade.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_71>There were unusual features throughout the house, such as the bathroom that was entirely covered from floor to ceiling in pink shag carpeting and had a heart-shaped tub. Hargitay also had a heart-shaped pool built in the yard for his wife, with gold tiles that spelled out “I Love You Jaynie.” Mansfield loved her home so much that she continued to live there even after she and Hargitay divorced in 1964.</p><h2 id=h-did-she-haunt-her-pink-palace>Did she haunt her Pink Palace?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_74>In 1967, Mansfield and her boyfriend Sam Brody were killed in a car accident. The sudden death of the star was shocking but what came next was chilling.&nbsp;After a few residents had come and gone from the home amidst rumors of strange things happening, former <a href=#>Beatles member Ringo Starr</a> moved in. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Architectural Digest</a>, he tried to paint the house white several times. But the original pink color kept seeping through the paint.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_56>Singer Engelbert Humperdinck also lived in the Pink Palace after Mansfield’s death. He had been romantically involved with the actor at one point in her life, and he claimed that she visited him as a ghost. He had the house blessed by a Catholic priest, and he said that he never saw Mansfield again after that.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_50>The Pink Palace was demolished in 2002, and no further ghostly events have been reported at the site. But whether Mansfield’s spirit actually stayed in the house for years after her death or not, the stories certainly got people talking. And that is something that she surely would have enjoyed.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3osXNnmSmmZ6os6qxy51kq52gpL%2B1scOlsGagkaq7tbHDZqeipptivaK4wJycZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-threatening-legal-action-over-nude-pics-internet-reacts-2015910.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber Threatening Legal Action Over Nude Pics: Internet Reacts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./afl-star-nathan-broad-and-tayla-damir-attend-bar-bambi-event-in-melbourne-with-fellow-wags.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AFL starNathan Broad and Tayla Damir attend Bar Bambi event in Melbourne with fellow WAGS</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
