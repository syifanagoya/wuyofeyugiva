Even someone like <a href=#>The Game </a>can agree with this. He recently shared a post highlighting how he is learning to let his daughter enjoy a bit of independence by allowing the 13-year-old to choose her own <a href=#>Halloween costume</a> for the first time.</p><p>The father-of-three started off his post, “Happy Halloween or whatever… I don’t know what I did, but the good lord is really paying me back through my only daughter…. I love this girl with all my heart. She is my world…. And as tall, beautiful & as smart as she is…. I miss my little baby who had a lisp & couldn’t dance to save her life lmaooo.”&nbsp;</p><p>“She makes straight A’s.. heavy on the straight….,” he continued. “So this is the 1st Halloween I allowed her to pick her own costume & she went straight to @fashionnova with her moms card with no hesitation lol… she kept it cute but I still low key wanna fight somebody… I just don’t know who ? [And someone tell her we are a 49ers household].”</p><p>The Game concluded, “To all the fathers with beautiful daughters… I feel your pain ? Scroll to see the adorableness from Halloween’s past ?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/10/Cali-The-Game.png><p>And of course, there were plenty of social media comments about the 13-year-old’s choice of costume, outside of it being a Cowboys uniform, many were questioning the overall appropriateness of the costume all together.</p><p>One Instagram user wrote, “So because she made straight A’s you allow her to dress at a age that isn’t appropriate? Dont get upset when she starts getting piped down at that age ether ?”</p><p>Another said, “Stop letting these mamas pressure you men into letting your daughter do something you clearly don’t want her to do.. she 13. Shirt could have been longer and it still would have been just a cute.”</p><p>“Nahh family cause if you did, WE as the fathers with beautiful daughters will not EVER let are 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER go out in public like that,” the post began from another user. “Straight As don’t mean you dress up like a hoochie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/10/Cali-The-Game2.png><p>This isn’t the first time that Cali Dream’s choice of outfit was brought into question under the fashion police microscope. If you remember, last year, for the <a href=#>Combs Twins 16th birthday</a>, Cali Dream set the internet abuzz where debates on both sides of the coin brought into question whether or not her style was appropriate for the occasion. The Dream immediately came to the defense of his daughter, shutting critics down.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Cali Dream, the 43-year-old also shares 16-year-old King Justice with ex Tiffney Cambridge. The Dream, (Jayceon Terrell Taylor), is also father to 20-year-old Harlem Caron, with whom he shares with ex Aleska Jordan.</p><p>Photo Credit(s)/Featured Image: The Game Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZ%2BeZZeWuqZ5wKWjqK%2BjYsGmsc1mm5qtl53Bpr6MraZmqJmYuG60xKtkqK%2BeYrWiuMuorp6dnmKwsL%2FTrqSeZZakv26yyKuqrWWknrqmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mccarthy-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John McCarthy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trini-kwans-death-in-netflixs-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-once-always-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trini Kwans death in Netflixs Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp;amp; Always, explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
