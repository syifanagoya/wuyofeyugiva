During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the subject of Jost's bachelor party came up and, surprisingly, Johansson had some pretty strong thoughts about who would be planning it, not what would go down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jost's Saturday Night Live co-star, Michael Che, dropped some hints about what the bash could possibly entail when he was on Fallon's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>show last September</a>. Che insisted that he had to step in to plan it, because if Jost was left to his own devices, "it would be so boring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It would be definitely in the daytime and Scarlett will certainly be there," Che said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>NBC/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johansson axed that idea, saying that Che would definitely not be planning it. In fact, she seemed surprised that anyone took the suggestion seriously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Michael's not throwing it. He's not," Johansson insisted. "Is this is a thing now?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's not that Johansson thinks that things would get out of hand if Che was in charge, it's the opposite. She told Fallon that if he was spearheading the festivities, it would actually be too low-key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh, no. I don't think that's a good idea," she said. "I feel like if he throws it, it's going to be, like, by the Port Authority. And it's gonna be very local. I don't think that's a good idea." She then turned straight to the camera, saying, "Michael, I know where you work, Michael."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Che has some history with Jost and Johansson. Back in July, he surprised the couple during Jost's birthday dinner by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sending a clown</a>. While Johansson looks like she had a great time in Che's Instagram Story documenting the incident, Jost looks less than amused. Maybe Johansson should give Che a little more credit, it's clear he knows how to have a good time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGejmK6zuMStq2ain52ur7%2FSqKVmm5%2Bhtq95yaiqrWWSlrCpscuoqWaokafBug%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-lauer-and-annette-roque-reportedly-close-to-divorce-settlement-291314.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Lauer And Annette Roque Reportedly Close To Divorce Settlement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-dern-plaid-coat-amazon-fashion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get Laura Derns Plaid Coat Look With This Amazon Pick</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
