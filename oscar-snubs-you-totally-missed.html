Lady Gaga for House of Gucci (2021)</h3><p>The world-renowned singer and actress <a href=# rel=noopener>Lady Gaga</a> was born in 1986 as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.</p><p>Along with giving numerous hits, the singer has starred in a bunch of movies.</p><p>Likewise, she has secured awards and nominations for her roles such as BAFTA, Academy Award, Primetime Emmy, AACTA International, Atlanta Film Critics, and so on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Lady-Gaga-in-House-of-Gucci-Source-New-York-Post.jpg><p>Sadly, Gaga was snubbed recently from Oscars for her part in House of Gucci (2021). The movie was directed by Ridley Scott and managed to collect <strong>$152.1 million </strong>at the box office.</p><p>The actress portrayed the role of Patrizia Reggiani in the movie along with other promising actors like Jared Leto, Al Pacino, and Adam Driver. However, she was left out of this year’s Oscar race.</p><p>The movie only landed one Oscar nomination for makeup and hairstyle.</p><p><strong>Nominated Instead</strong>: <a href=# rel=noopener>Kristen Stewart</a> for playing Princess Diana in Spencer.</p><h3>#2. Andrew Garfield for tick,&nbsp;tick…BOOM! (2021)</h3><p>Andrew Garfield is most commonly known for his role as Peter Parker in the movie The Amazing Spiderman (2012) and (2014).</p><p>The actor was snubbed for his role in tick, tick…BOOM, a 2021 movie. The movie presented the life of an aspiring composer portrayed by Garfield.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Andrew-Garfield-subbed-for-tick-tick...BOOM-Source-Deadline-scaled.jpg><p>To illustrate, tick, tick…BOOM! is an adaptation of the life of late Jonathan Larson, the American composer and lyricist.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was very inspiring, it seems like the Academy voters could fit only one musical in the category of best picture.</p><p><strong>So, who was nominated instead?</strong> The coveted spot on the best picture list was bagged by Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car.</p><h3>#3. Denis Villeneuve for Dune (2021)</h3><p>We heard a lot about Dune this year, and it indeed was a very beautiful movie with brilliant actors like Timothee Chalamaet, <a href=#>Zendaya</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Josh Brolin</a>, Oscar Isaac, and so on.</p><p>Unfortunately, the movie was snubbed, and the director Denis Villeneuve did not win the Best Director nomination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dune-Source-The-New-York-Times.jpg><p>Nevertheless, Dune took home altogether ten nominations for several categories such as Best Cinematography, Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Editing, and a lot more. Let’s just say it was not a year for Villeneuve.</p><p><strong>So, who won? </strong>Instead of Dune, the winning film was Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Lost Daughter.”</p><h3>#4. Jon Watts for Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)</h3><p>Our beloved and the sensational movie of this year, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> (2021)!</p><p>The movie collected over <strong>$1.77 billion </strong>in a global theatre. However, Jon Watts could not land the award for the best picture category.</p><p>The film starred Benedict Cumberbatch, <a href=#>Tobey Maguire</a>, Andrew Garfield, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Willem Dafoe, and a lot more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-Source-Hindustan-Times.jpeg><p>Like Jon Watts, none of the aforementioned actors received any awards in the Oscar. Sadly, the only nomination bagged by this film was for visual effects.</p><p><strong>Interesting detail</strong>: The same year, J.K Simmons, who was also a major part of NWH, bagged the award for the best supporting actor but for another movie- <strong>Being the Ricardos.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>30 Richest Celebrities in the World…</strong></a></p><h3>#5. Ruth Negga for Passing (2021)</h3><p>In 2021, the director Rebecca Hall made the movie Passing (2021), starring powerful actresses like Ruth Negga and Tessa Thompson.</p><p>Negga portrayed the character of Clare Bellew, a mixed-race black woman. The movie was widely praised, and Ruth Negga was equally acclaimed by the reviewers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ruth-and-Tessa-Source-USA-Today.jpg><p>However, like all the above-mentioned names, Ruth was also snubbed for this film. Well, the actress did receive a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor at the SAG Awards.</p><p><strong>Nominated instead</strong>: Nightmare Alley (2021) managed to pick the best picture nomination. Moreover, it also earned the nomination for costume and cinematography.</p><h3>#6. Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight (2008)</h3><p>We bet there is no need to introduce <a href=# rel=noopener>Christopher Nolan</a>, one of the finest directors Hollywood has! Now more even, this brilliant movie Nolan directed- The Dark Knight (2008).</p><p>The movie turned out to be a cult classic and features great actors like <a href=# rel=noopener>Christian Bale</a> as Batman and the late Heath Ledger as the joker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dark-Knight-Rises.jpg><p>Unfortunately, this cultural phenomenon film was overlooked for the Oscars in the category of Best Picture, and Nolan got snubbed.</p><p><strong>Which movie won instead?-</strong> The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire.</p><h3>#7. James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock for Vertigo (1958)</h3><p>The master of suspense “Alfred Hitchcock” is one of the best directors the film industry has seen. Hitchcock is celebrated for directing thrillers, but sadly, this man never won an Oscar.</p><p>Here, we are talking about the 1958 movie Vertigo directed by Hitchcock starring James Stewart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vertigo-1958-Source-Encyclopedia-Britannica.jpg><p>This duo is frequently seen together. Likewise, Vertigo is considered Alfred’s masterwork, along with Stewart’s best performance. But as stated earlier, the film could not bring the Oscars for either of them.<span id=editable-content-within-article~4~2~0 class="jss2663 jss2836"></span></p><p><strong>So, who got nominated for the Best Picture award instead?-</strong> Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), and <span class="jss2661 jss2835"><span class="jss2663 jss2836">Auntie Mame (1958)</span></span></p><p><strong>And who won?-</strong> Gigi (1958)</p><h3>#8. Stanley Kubrick for The Shining (1980)</h3><p>One of the greatest filmmakers of cinematic history, Stanley Kubrick, has given several classic masterpieces.</p><p>In 1980, Stanley directed The Shining, which is regarded as one of the finest movies in Hollywood.</p><p>Sadly, The Shining did not receive the critical acclaim it deserved. Instead, it got only two Razzie nominations, and you will be surprised that Kubrick was nominated for Worst Director.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Shining-1980-Source-The-Times-scaled.jpg><p>Fortunately, viewers understood this treasure with time, and it still is acclaimed to date.</p><p><strong>Nominated Instead</strong>: Coal Miner’s Daughter, The Elephant Man, Tess</p><p>A little extra detail: Stanley was robbed one more time for another masterpiece- 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p><p>Even though this movie made in 1968 is greatly appreciated today, it got snubbed at that time. Instead, the movies like Funny Girl, The Lion in Winter, Oliver!, etc., secured their places.<span id=inputElements~c9f7535ee96c9fc0 class=MuiTypography-root></span></p><h3>#9. Anthony Perkins for Psycho (1960)</h3><p>We have already stated this before that even though Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing filmmakers, he never landed with an Oscars.</p><p>The same is the case for his 1960 movie Psycho. But here, we are not just talking about the director but the actor Anthony Perkins who portrayed the role of Norman Bates in the movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Anthony-Perkins-in-Psycho-Source-IMDb.jpg><p>In Psycho, Perkins outdid himself with such a classic act. However, he was snubbed for the category of best actor.</p><p>Who won it instead? Jack Lemmon for The Apartment, Laurence Oliver for The Entertainer, Burt Lancaster for Elmer Gantry, and so on.</p><h3>#10. Steven Spielberg for Jaws (1975)</h3><p>In 1975, maybe the best directors’ category was crowded, or just Steven Spielberg got unlucky, but this excellent director was robbed for the masterpiece he made- <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Jaws</a>.</p><p>Spielberg was snubbed for the best director while he created the summer blockbuster that audiences will forever love and remember.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jaws-1975-by-Steven-Spielberg-Source-MoMA.jpg><p>The movie was prepared on a budget of $9 million and managed to earn $472 million. As a matter of fact, Jaws changed how we watch movies and inspired so many upcoming filmmakers.</p><p>Now, instead of Steven, other directors like Milos Forman (<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), </i>Stanley Kubrick<i> (Barry Lyndon)</i>, and Sidney Lumet<i> (Dog Day Afternoon) </i>won the nomination that year.</p><p><strong>Read About <a href=# rel=noopener>Academy Award for Best Cinematography: Ranked 10 Winners</a></strong></p><h3>#11. Gary Oldman for Sid and Nancy (1986)</h3><p>In 1986, Alex Cox directed “Sid and Nancy,” starring Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb in the lead role.</p><p>It is a British biographical film, and for this, Gary totally changed himself to fit into the character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Gary-Oldman-in-Sid-and-Nancy-Source-Paste-Magazine.jpg><p>To illustrate, Oldman portrayed himself as Sid, the guy who is a punk icon as well as a drug addict and a killer. He lost too much weight and mentally devoted himself to the role.</p><p>Sadly, Gary Oldman was not able to bring the Oscars home. He was snubbed for Best Actor.</p><p>Instead of him, the actors who received the honors were James Woods (<i>Salvador</i>), Paul Newman (The Color of Money), Bob Hoskins (Mona Lisa), and others.</p><h3>#12. Gene Kelly for Singin’ in the Rain (1952)</h3><p>The 1952 movie Singin’ in the Rain is equally tasteful today as it was when first released.</p><p>The musical movie stars Eugene Curran Kelly or Gene Kelly, an American actor, director, singer, and dancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Singin-in-the-Rain-Source-Mental-Floss.jpg><p>The handsome actor was popular for his athletic dancing style, and his role in the very movie held audiences spellbound.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was overlooked for the best actor. The Academy failed to acknowledge him despite his sheer talent, and Kelly got snubbed.</p><p>The same year, some of the other nominations who managed to win included Gary Cooper (High Noon), Kirk Douglas (<i>The Bad and the Beautiful</i>), and so on.</p><p><strong>Also, Read About <a href=# rel=noopener>the 15 Worst Oscars Dresses of all Time…!</a></strong></p><h3>#13. Bradley Cooper for A Star is Born (2018)</h3><p>There are several actors and directors who get snubbed each year during the Academy Awards. Bradley Cooper also joined this list for the 2018’s movie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A Star is Born</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bradley-Cooper-in-A-Star-is-Born-Source-Harpers-Bazaar-scaled.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Cooper</a> both directed and starred in this film. As a matter of fact, it was his directorial debut.</p><p>The actor starred along with Lady Gaga, and yes, the film got several nominees and other big awards. However, Bradley was overlooked for his directorial/lead role.</p><h3>#14. Timothee Chalamet for Beautiful Boy (2018)</h3><p>Timothee Chalamet is a growing name in the Hollywood film industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Timothee-Chalamet-in-Beautiful-Boy-Source-Vox.jpg><p>The gorgeous American actor was born in 1995 and has appeared in several great movies like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Call Me By Your Name</a> (2017), Dune (2021), Interstellar (2014), Little Women (2019), and several others.</p><p>And here, we are talking about his work in the 2018’s movie Beautiful Boy, for which he was overlooked. The drama film won him several big nominations, but he was snubbed from the Oscars.</p><h3>#15. Emily Blunt for A Quiet Place (2018)</h3><p>If you remember, the talented British actress Emily Blunt is one of the most overdue actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>Blunt has never been lucky for an Oscars even though she performed greatly in the movies like “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Devil Wears Prada</a>” and “Into the Woods.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emily-Blunt-in-A-Quiet-Place-Source-The-Indian-Express.jpg><p>Likewise, she was snubbed for the Best Actress for her role in 2018’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A Quiet Place</a>.
