She is without doubt best known to the worldwide audience thanks to her infrequent presence on the TV screen and across the media outlets, as the wife of actor Graham Wardle since April 2015. In spite of being in the public eye since then, Alison has shared practically nothing about her personal life, which leaves no more verified information about her.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Graham_Wardle>Who is Graham Wardle?</span></h2><p>Born under the sign of Virgo on the 6th of September 1986, in Mission, British Columbia, Canada, Graham Wardle is a 33 year-old Caucasian actor, producer, casting director, editor and soundtrack producer.</p><p>He owes the greatest portion of his popularity to the fact that he’s been involved in a lead role in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>highly successful</a> CBC produced family drama entitled “Heartland” since its inception in 2007. He has also had some other successes over the course of his often lucrative entertainment career since 1998.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education_A_fortuitous_accident>Early life and education: A fortuitous accident</span></h2><p>Graham was raised in his birthplace alongside five siblings by their father and mother, all of unknown names and professions. Regarding his childhood interests, Graham was influenced very early and by accident, which definitely directed his passion later on. At one point when he was six years old, he happened be sitting with his mother in a room full of children auditioning for a commercial. Initially unbeknownst to both of them, this event led to Graham appearing on screen for the first time.</p><p>As for his education, he attended an unspecified high school in his birthplace, from where he matriculated in 2004. He then proceeded to improve his acting skills by enrolling into Capilano University in Vancouver, from where he graduated with an unspecified degree in motion picture and production programs in 2007.</p><h2><span id=Career_In_stardom_since_childhood>Career: In stardom since childhood</span></h2><p>Graham found his first official on-screen professional engagement when he was only 12 years old, at which point he got to star as Young Aaron in the action adventure crime film by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo entitled “The Sentinel”. In 1999 Wardle made his TV series debut by starring as Bif in the episode of “The New Addams Family” entitled “Fester the Marriage Counselor”. In 2000 he got to portray Tod in the comedy fantasy film by Thom Eberhardt entitled “Ratz”, thus marking his film debut.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MV5BNTc0MGQ5NTUtYmRlMy00YWUzLTg2YWQtMWM5YmEwOThiNDBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE0MTUwOTQ@._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_-1024x683.jpg></p><p>The year after, Graham played Man in the episode of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>iconic</a> fantasy horror drama series “The Outer Limits” entitled “Family Values”. The young star then took a break from acting for two years until he finished his high school education, returned to the screen in 2004 in the role of Adam Kitsis in “Life as We Know It”. In 2005 Graham was Robert Yorke Hyde in “Killer Bash”, while in 2006 he realized two roles – in “Like Mike 2: Streetball” and “Fallen”. In 2007 he played Gabe Foley in “In the Land of Women”, Seth Corbin in “Anna’s Storm”, but their prestige doesn’t compare to the third one.</p><h3><span id=The_sudden_ascent_through_Hollywood>The sudden ascent through Hollywood</span></h3><p>Graham’s most important career breakthrough was his third role in 2007, as Ty Borden, one of the three lead characters in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>wildly popular</a> family drama TV series by CBC entitled “Heartland”. Over 13 seasons of the show since 2007, the latest of which started airing in September 2019, Graham has been featured in 203 out of a total 214 episodes of the show.</p><p>Graham has also had some other roles over the years since he joined the cast – in 2008 he played Danny McNabb in “That One Night”, while in 2009 he realized the character of Chris in “Yesterday”, then in 2010 CBC released the show-related film entitled “A Heartland Christmas”, in which he starred as the same character. Two years later, Wardle was featured in “Mon Ami”, while in 2013 he had two more roles, one of them being his second short appearance as Tommy Collins in “Supernatural” (first in 2005), and the other Kyle in “Grave Halloween”. Finally, in 2019 he starred as Ty in “Hudson”. He remains active in “Heartland”, and likely to stay in it until the show finishes at an unspecified point. Naturally, this is his greatest source of income.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Goood Morning people! I must be going back to shoot season 11 today because I'm having dreams about being on set. <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/NwNhiwEXL0</a></p><p>— Graham Wardle (@GrahamWardle) <a rel=nofollow href=#>May 4, 2017</a></p><h3><span id=His_artistic_stints>His artistic stints</span></h3><p>After gradually gaining experience over the years, Graham decided a few times that he’d stray from simply being an actor and try something else. Hence, he’s produced three short films so far – “Under Pressure: A Story of Microscopic Stakes” (2008), “The Vessel” (2012) and “Mi Madre, My Father” in 2018. Wardle was also the editor and casting director for the short film entitled “Versus” in 2007, and he vocally performed for the “Born to Be Wild” soundtrack in “Heartland”. Lastly, he published the book entitled “Find Your Truth” in 2014, which he sells on <a rel=nofollow href=#>his own website</a> alongside autographed photos.</p><h2><span id=Grahams_awards_and_nominations>Graham’s awards and nominations</span></h2><p>Since the famous actor has less than 20 credited roles for now, he hasn’t had too many opportunities to provide award-winning performances. Still, his unforgettable presence in “Heartland” has been greatly commended, and sometimes even officially with a nomination.</p><p>In 2009, 2010 and 2012 Graham was nominated for the Leo Award in the Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series category, two for specific episodes and one for his total performance in the show. In 2019 he also received a nomination for the Canadian Screen Award in the Cogeco Fund Audience Choice Award category, for the same show.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_A_loving_husband>Love life: A loving husband</span></h2><p>As for Wardle’s romantic involvements, there is no information about this part of his life leading up to the one with his now wife. He and Alison Wardle are thought to have dated for at least five years prior to marrying in a private ceremony in 2015, completely hidden from the public eye. They haven’t had any children thus far. There’s been no controversy about their union since, but the fans do keep bringing up one thing of a different nature.</p><p>Since Ty Borden, the character he portrays in “Heartland”, has a very passionate on-screen relationship with Amy Fleming, the character of actress Amber Marshall, some in the audience have insinuated displeasure by the fact that they aren’t also married in real life. If anything, this only contributes to the quality of performance provided by both of the stars, and doesn’t in any way influence their separate marriages. The Wardles reside apparently happily together at an undisclosed location in Canada.</p><h2><span id=Talk_show_and_TV_show_star>Talk show and TV show star</span></h2><p>According to Graham’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter post</a> from September 2019, there looks to be a talk show related to “Heartland”. He said ‘Mr. Weinberg is Heartland’s very own executive producer. Today is his birthday. I hope you have a great one sir! Check out his very polished and professional talk show. I’ll be making an appearance on it later this year.’</p><h2><span id=Convincingly_dominant>Convincingly dominant</span></h2><p>When Canadian citizens were asked by tv-eh.com, arguably one of the most popular TV-related sites in Canada, to vote for the show they wanted to see more of in September 2019, “Heartland” claimed an <a rel=nofollow href=#>obvious victory</a>, with 39% of the total votes for all of the most popular Canadian shows.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Graham_Wardles_net_worth>What is Graham Wardle’s net worth?</span></h2><p>Have you lately taken a second to wonder what Graham Wardle’s net worth could be, especially nearing the end of 2019? Some of the most credible sources have estimated this amount to be more than $3 million, earned thanks to consistent excellence in performing in the entertainment business, most prominently by playing the lead character Ty Borden in “Heartland”. Considering the fact that his career is still in full bloom, the said amount will most definitely grow.</p><h2><span id=Alison_Wardles_body_measurements>Alison Wardle’s body measurements</span></h2><p>So, what do you believe to be the physical specifications of Graham’s wife? Her height, weight and vital statistics are not known as of yet, while her body shape is generally described as regular. Alison’s dress, shoe and bra size are also not publicly available. She has bright blond hair and light green eyes, with a mostly pale but often tanned complexion.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Do you ever think about the amount of time this famous couple spends on the internet? Alison doesn’t seem to be interested in enjoying her fame through social media profiles, but Graham uses every available opportunity to promote “Heartland” on all three of the most popular social media networks, engaging with the fans on an almost daily basis by sharing various kinds of information about his professional and personal life. His <a rel=nofollow href=#>Facebook</a> has close to 60,000 fans, his <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter</a> almost 2,000, and his <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> more than 250,000 followers.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmmqSZqLyvedaaqZ2klWLEqrfIZq6inpVitLOtx5qkZq%2BRp7GtsYyanp5lp5qxpbXNoGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremy-bloom-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeremy Bloom Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-burtons-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tim Burton Dating Tim Burton's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
