The team can offer him a five-year deal next offseason worth <strong>$230 million</strong>. The deal would kick in starting in the 2020-21 season and would result in Davis having the wealthiest contract in the league.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-259906 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/anthony.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-259906 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To earn the super-max, a player either has to make the All-NBA team or win Defensive Player of the Year in two out of the past three seasons, or win MVP in one of the previous three seasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The player must also be on the team that drafted him or has to have been traded on his rookie deal to another team.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Davis will likely benefit from making the All-NBA team, several other notable players will not receive supermax contracts.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>Klay Thompson</a> didn't earn All-NBA honors, so he won't be eligible this summer. However, if he makes one of the three All-NBA teams next year, he could sign the supermax next offseason, when he's a free agent. Similarly, <a href=# rel=noopener>Draymond Green</a> didn't make the All-NBA team this year but could do so next season. However, since <a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a> has already agreed to a supermax deal, only one, either Green or Thompson could potentially sign a supermax contract.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>Paul George</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Butler</a> could have signed supermax deals or extensions if they had stayed with the Pacers and Bulls respectively. Instead, they gave up that ability when they were traded.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So don't feel too bad for Davis. Even though his Pelicans fell to the Warriors in the second round, he's about to become a very wealthy man.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlraCfo8ZusMCvoKxlmah6tLHTZquoZaOetK95wGajmqqXmr9ur86nq6uZk6l6tbTAp2Sapqliva2t2J6pZqGeYrujrYyhoKysn6fGbn2RbGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agt-heidi-klum-bedridden-video-food-poisoning-emmys-after-party.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heidi Klum shares bedridden video as she reveals food poisoning after Emmys party watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./troian-bellisario.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Troian Bellisario</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-unconventional-beauty-product-shower-favourite.html>Kendall Jenner reveals her unconventional shower essential</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esports-news-valorant-less-valorant-settings-2022-sensitivity-crosshair-keybindings-and-pc-specs.html>Less Valorant Settings 2022: Sensitivity, Crosshair, Keybindings, and PC Specs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-shahzada-dawoods-parents.html>Who are Shahzada Dawoods Parents?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alisha-newton-heartland.html>Alisha Newton: Early Life, Movies, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicago-med-recap-02-21-24-season-9-episode-5-i-make-a-promise-i-will-never-leave-you.html>Chicago Med Recap 02/21/24: Season 9 Episode 5 I Make a Promise, I Will Never Leave You</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
