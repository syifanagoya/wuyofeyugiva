rel="noopener nofollow">Samson François</a>, especially as he passed away in 1970, we can speculate that his influence and the enduring popularity of his recordings would have made him financially

amassed wealth through extensive recordings like modern artists, but his distinctive style and dedicated fan base certainly carved a unique niche.</p><p>Unlike Ravel, who had numerous compositions to
